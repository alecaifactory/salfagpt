3. **Social Proof** - "1,234 agents created this week"
4. **Habit Formation** - Hook model (trigger ‚Üí action ‚Üí reward ‚Üí investment)
5. **Delight Through Intelligence** - Auto-complete, smart suggestions, wow moments

**North Star Metric**: Weekly Active Agents Used
- Proxy for value delivered
- Predicts retention and expansion
- Correlates with willingness to pay

**Engagement Loops:**
1. Personal Productivity Loop (2-4 weeks)
2. Team Collaboration Loop (1-2 months)  
3. Data Quality Loop (6-12 months) - **Strongest moat**
4. Template Marketplace Loop (3-6 months)

## ‚úÖ Success Metrics

### MVP Goals
- 80% of users create first agent within 7 days
- 90% of agents pass evaluation on first submission
- <2s response time for chat interactions
- NPS score > 50 from domain experts and admins

### Technical Requirements
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility
- Multi-language support (EN, ES, PT)

## üîê Security & Compliance

- OAuth 2.0 + JWT authentication
- Role-based authorization at API level
- AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Input validation and CORS policies
- Regular security audits

## üöÄ Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review PRD** with product and engineering stakeholders
2. **Create Technical Architecture** diagrams (system, data flow, sequence)
3. **Define API Contracts** for all endpoints
4. **Design Database Schema** with migrations
5. **Set Up Development Environment** (repo structure, CI/CD)

### Phase 1 Tasks (Weeks 1-2)
1. Initialize Astro project with TypeScript
2. Set up Tailwind CSS and design system
3. Implement authentication with Supabase
4. Build RBAC middleware
5. Create user management interface
6. Design database schema and run initial migrations

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] Technical architecture diagrams
- [ ] API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] User onboarding guide

## üìö Key Decisions Made

1. **Vector Store**: Pinecone (managed service, proven scale)
2. **Auth Provider**: Supabase (integrated auth + database)
3. **Primary Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (multimodal, cost-effective)
4. **Evaluation Approach**: Automated with human review for edge cases
5. **Deployment**: Phased rollout over 14 weeks

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Open Questions

1. Agent re-evaluation frequency after approval?
   - **Proposal**: Monthly for active agents, on-demand for changes

2. Cost management for expensive agents?
   - **Proposal**: Auto-pause + notification when threshold reached

3. Agent versioning strategy?
   - **Proposal**: Semantic versioning, major changes require re-approval

4. Multi-tenancy support?
   - **Decision**: Phase 2 feature, not MVP

## üìä Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM API rate limits | High | Queue system, multi-provider fallback |
| Vector store costs | Medium | Optimize embeddings, caching |
| Complex evaluation | High | Start simple, iterate |
| User adoption | High | Comprehensive onboarding, templates |
| Security issues | Critical | Regular audits, penetration testing |
