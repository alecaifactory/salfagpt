# Chat Interface with RBAC - Project Summary

## 🎯 What We Built

A comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for an enterprise-grade AI agent platform with sophisticated role-based access control and quality assurance workflows.

## 📊 Key Features

### 1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
7 distinct user roles with granular permissions:
- **Superadmin** & **Admin**: Full platform access
- **Analytics**: Read-only metrics and reports
- **User**: Personal agent creation and usage
- **Domain Expert**: Define success criteria and validate responses
- **Agent Reviewer**: Quality assurance testing
- **Agent Approver**: Final approval authority

### 2. **Feature Access Matrix**
40+ features mapped across all roles with clear permissions:
- Agent Management (create, edit, delete, share)
- Knowledge Management (upload, configure processors)
- Chat Interface (conversations, history)
- Evaluation & Approval (submit, review, approve)
- Analytics & Reporting (metrics, exports)
- System Configuration (settings, integrations)

### 3. **Agent Configuration System**
Comprehensive agent setup with:
- **Model Selection**: Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, OpenAI GPT
- **Personality & Behavior**: System prompts, tone, constraints
- **Knowledge Base**: Multiple sources and processors
- **Advanced Settings**: Function calling, tools, guardrails

### 4. **Knowledge Importer**
8 processor types for different data sources:
- **Embedding**: Vector search for large documents
- **Direct Inference**: Small datasets sent directly to LLM
- **Python Execution**: Custom data processing
- **Vision Models**: Image and document analysis
- **Audio Transcription**: Meeting notes and podcasts
- **Web Scraper**: Real-time web content
- **Database Connector**: Enterprise data integration
- **API Integration**: Third-party data sources

### 5. **Evaluation & Approval Workflow**
Quality assurance system with:
- **Automated Evaluation**: N-run tests with evaluator agent
- **Success Criteria**: Defined by domain experts
- **Approval CRM**: Dashboard for reviewers and approvers
- **User Tracking**: Status visibility for agent creators

## 📈 Implementation Timeline

**14-week plan across 7 phases:**

| Phase | Duration | Focus |
|-------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Weeks 1-2 | Foundation & RBAC |
| 2 | Weeks 3-4 | Agent Management |
| 3 | Weeks 5-6 | Knowledge Importer |
| 4 | Weeks 7-8 | Chat Interface |
| 5 | Weeks 9-10 | Evaluation System |
| 6 | Weeks 11-12 | Approval Workflow |
| 7 | Weeks 13-14 | Polish & Launch |

## ✅ Success Metrics

### MVP Goals
- 80% of users create first agent within 7 days
- 90% of agents pass evaluation on first submission
- <2s response time for chat interactions
- NPS score > 50 from domain experts and admins

### Technical Requirements
- 99.9% uptime SLA
- Support 10,000+ concurrent users
- WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility
- Multi-language support (EN, ES, PT)

## 🔐 Security & Compliance

- OAuth 2.0 + JWT authentication
- Role-based authorization at API level
- AES-256 encryption at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Input validation and CORS policies
- Regular security audits

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Review PRD** with product and engineering stakeholders
2. **Create Technical Architecture** diagrams (system, data flow, sequence)
3. **Define API Contracts** for all endpoints
4. **Design Database Schema** with migrations
5. **Set Up Development Environment** (repo structure, CI/CD)

### Phase 1 Tasks (Weeks 1-2)
1. Initialize Astro project with TypeScript
2. Set up Tailwind CSS and design system
3. Implement authentication with Supabase
4. Build RBAC middleware
5. Create user management interface
6. Design database schema and run initial migrations

### Documentation Needed
- [ ] Technical architecture diagrams
- [ ] API specification (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- [ ] Database schema documentation
- [ ] Deployment guide
- [ ] User onboarding guide

## 📚 Key Decisions Made

1. **Vector Store**: Pinecone (managed service, proven scale)
2. **Auth Provider**: Supabase (integrated auth + database)
3. **Primary Model**: Google Gemini 2.5 Pro (multimodal, cost-effective)
4. **Evaluation Approach**: Automated with human review for edge cases
5. **Deployment**: Phased rollout over 14 weeks

## ⚠️ Open Questions

1. Agent re-evaluation frequency after approval?
   - **Proposal**: Monthly for active agents, on-demand for changes

2. Cost management for expensive agents?
   - **Proposal**: Auto-pause + notification when threshold reached

3. Agent versioning strategy?
   - **Proposal**: Semantic versioning, major changes require re-approval

4. Multi-tenancy support?
   - **Decision**: Phase 2 feature, not MVP

## 📊 Risk Assessment

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| LLM API rate limits | High | Queue system, multi-provider fallback |
| Vector store costs | Medium | Optimize embeddings, caching |
| Complex evaluation | High | Start simple, iterate |
| User adoption | High | Comprehensive onboarding, templates |
| Security issues | Critical | Regular audits, penetration testing |
