## 🎨 Key Innovations (Patent-Pending)

### 1. Stella Marker Design ⭐

**Visual:**
- Purple (#a855f7) → Yellow (#fbbf24) → Green (#10b981) cycling
- Golden tail (Stella characteristic)
- Smooth 2-second transitions
- Gentle pulse animation

**Submit Animation:**
- Blue spin (360°, 500ms)
- Scale down (300ms)  
- Star explosion (8 stars radiating)
- Fade out (400ms)
- Checkmark badge with ticket ID

**Why it's novel:** No competitor has this level of visual delight

### 2. Viral Share Chain Tracking ⭐

**Algorithm:**
- Multi-level attribution (track reshares of reshares)
- Calculate viral coefficient: VC = (Shares + Engagement × Quality) / Views
- Identify influencers (users with >10 resulting upvotes)
- Build network graph of propagation

**Why it's novel:** First privacy-first viral loop for enterprise B2B

### 3. Dynamic Priority Boosting ⭐

**Formula (Proprietary):**
```
Priority Score = Base + Log(Upvotes)×15 + ViralCoef×30 + 
                 ExpertUpvotes×10 + Shares×5 + ImpactScore + Urgency
```

**Conversion:**
- >140: Critical
- >100: High
- >60: Medium
- <60: Low

**Why it's novel:** Organic, democratic, gaming-resistant

### 4. Privacy-First Social Sharing ⭐

**Two-Layer Cards:**
- **Public preview**: Type, anonymized creator, upvote count
- **Authenticated**: Full details, screenshots, AI analysis

**Access Control:**
- Company SSO required
- Email domain verification
- No cross-company access

**Why it's novel:** Viral growth meets enterprise security
