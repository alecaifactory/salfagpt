# Context Management - Agent Filter Fix

**Date:** October 22, 2025  
**Component:** `ContextManagementDashboard.tsx`  
**Issue:** "Asignar a Agentes" section was showing ALL conversations instead of only active agents  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🎯 Problem

The Context Management Dashboard was displaying ALL conversations in the "Asignar a Agentes" section, including:
- ❌ Regular conversations/chats (isAgent === false)
- ❌ Archived agents (status === 'archived')

**User Expectation:**
> "I should only see agents that are active, that have not been archived, and that are not Conversations."

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated TypeScript Interface

**Added `isAgent` and `status` fields to conversations prop:**

```typescript
interface ContextManagementDashboardProps {
  // ... other fields
  conversations: Array<{ 
    id: string; 
    title: string;
    isAgent?: boolean;  // true = agent, false = chat, undefined = legacy (treat as agent)
    status?: 'active' | 'archived';  // Filter out archived agents
  }>;
}
```

### 2. Applied Filter in 4 Locations

**Location 1: Compact Agent Assignment (Single Source Selected)**
- **Lines:** 1786-1830
- **Filter:** Active agents only (not chats, not archived)
- **Empty State:** "No hay agentes activos. Crea un agente primero."

**Location 2: PUBLIC Tag Auto-Assignment**
- **Lines:** 1728-1756
- **Filter:** Only assign PUBLIC sources to active agents
- **Impact:** Prevents PUBLIC sources from being assigned to chats or archived agents

**Location 3: Bulk Agent Assignment (Multiple Sources Selected)**
- **Lines:** 1933-1975
- **Filter:** Active agents only in selection list
- **Empty State:** "No hay agentes activos. Crea un agente primero."

**Location 4: Assignment Summary**
- **Lines:** 2013-2046
- **Filter:** Only show active agents in summary preview
- **Impact:** Summary accurately reflects which agents will receive the sources

### Filter Logic (Applied in All 4 Locations)

```typescript
const activeAgents = conversations.filter(conv => {
  // Exclude chats
  if (conv.isAgent === false) return false;
  // Exclude archived
  if (conv.status === 'archived') return false;
  // Include agents (isAgent === true or undefined for legacy)
  return true;
});
```

## 📊 Impact

### Before Fix
```
Asignar a Agentes:
□ Agente M001          ← Agent (correct)
□ Nuevo Chat           ← Chat (WRONG - should not be here)
□ Agente Support       ← Agent (correct)
□ Hola que tal         ← Chat (WRONG - should not be here)
□ [Archived] Old Agent ← Archived (WRONG - should not be here)
```

### After Fix
```
Asignar a Agentes:
□ Agente M001          ← Agent only (active)
□ Agente Support       ← Agent only (active)
□ Agente HR            ← Agent only (active)
```

✅ Only active agents shown  
✅ Chats excluded  
✅ Archived agents excluded

## 🏗️ Architecture Alignment

This fix aligns with the established Agent vs Conversation architecture:

**Agents (`isAgent !== false`):**
- Manage context sources
- Have configuration
- Are reusable templates
- Can be assigned context sources

**Chats (`isAgent === false`):**
- Use agents
- Inherit context from parent agent
- Are specific conversation instances
- **Cannot** be assigned context sources directly

**Rule:** Context is assigned to agents, chats inherit from their parent agent.

## 🔍 Verification

### Test Scenarios

1. **Create an Agent**
   - ✅ Should appear in "Asignar a Agentes"

2. **Create a Chat (from an Agent)**
   - ✅ Should NOT appear in "Asignar a Agentes"

3. **Archive an Agent**
   - ✅ Should NOT appear in "Asignar a Agentes"

4. **Unarchive an Agent**
   - ✅ Should reappear in "Asignar a Agentes"

5. **Mark Source as PUBLIC**
   - ✅ Should auto-assign ONLY to active agents
   - ✅ Should NOT assign to chats
   - ✅ Should NOT assign to archived agents

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-22  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Backward Compatible:** Yes (legacy conversations without isAgent field treated as agents)

---

**Remember:** Context sources are assigned to agents (templates), not to individual chats. Chats inherit context from their parent agent. This maintains clear separation of concerns and prevents confusion in the UI.
