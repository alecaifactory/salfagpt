# Worktree Registry

Track all Git worktrees for the Flow platform.

## üìñ About This Registry

This file tracks all active, blocked, and archived Git worktrees for the Flow platform. Each worktree represents a parallel development effort that will eventually merge back to `main`.

**Purpose:**
- Centralized tracking of all worktrees
- Progress monitoring and alignment checks
- Merge readiness verification
- Historical record of completed work

**How to Use:**
1. Create entry when starting new worktree
2. Update daily with progress and alignment status
3. Mark as "Ready to Merge" when validation complete
4. Move to "Archived" section after merge and cleanup

**Merged:** 2025-01-13 (Commit: 32e2bf7)  
**Cleaned Up:** 2025-01-13  
**Duration:** 6-8 hours (same day)  
**Outcome:** ‚úÖ Successfully merged  
**Git Tag:** `worktree/1760301089974-275517`

**Summary:**
Implemented complete data persistence system for the Flow platform, expanding beyond conversations and messages to include:
- User global settings (UserSettings)
- Per-agent configurations (AgentConfig)
- Workflow configurations (WorkflowConfig)
- Conversation-specific context state (ConversationContext)
- Usage logs (UsageLog)

Created comprehensive testing infrastructure with multi-environment (localhost/production) and multi-user type (builder, admin, expert, user) support. Documented entire data schema in `.cursor/rules/data.mdc` and aligned all 23 project `.mdc` rules with `alwaysApply: true` configuration.

**Impact:**
- Files changed: 15+
- Lines added: ~5,000+
- Lines removed: ~50
- New features: 
  - 5 new Firestore collections
  - 4 new API endpoints (GET/POST for each)
  - Multi-environment seeding system
  - Multi-user testing framework
  - Complete data schema documentation
  - Full rules alignment verification
- Breaking changes: None (fully backward compatible)

**Key Achievements:**
1. Complete Persistence System: All user interactions, configurations, and state now persist in Firestore
2. Multi-Environment Testing: Separate seeding for localhost and production
3. Multi-User Testing: Data for builder, admin, expert, and standard user types
4. Comprehensive Documentation: New `data.mdc` rule and `RULES_ALIGNMENT.md` master document
5. Rule System Enhancement: Ensured all 23 `.mdc` rules are aligned and always applied
6. Backward Compatibility: Zero breaking changes, all existing functionality preserved

**Technical Highlights:**
- Firestore schema design with `source` tracking (localhost/production)
- TypeScript interfaces for all new data types
- API routes with proper authentication and validation
- Seeding scripts with environment-specific logic
- Verification scripts for testing
- Complete documentation in Cursor rules system

**Post-Merge Notes:**
- All seeding and verification tests passed successfully
- Firestore indexes required for some queries (documented in `data.mdc`)
- No production issues detected
- System ready for next phase of development

**Lessons Learned:**
- Git worktrees excellent for isolated, focused development
- Comprehensive testing data crucial for validating multi-user scenarios
- Documentation during development (not after) maintains quality
- Backward compatibility must be validated at every step
- Cursor rules system extremely valuable for maintaining alignment

**Follow-up Work:**
- Monitor Firestore query performance in production
- Consider implementing caching layer for frequently accessed settings
- Explore real-time updates for collaborative scenarios
- Add automated tests for new API endpoints
