**Features:**
- "1,234 agents created this week" (social proof)
- "People in Finance also created:" (recommendations)
- Agent leaderboard (most helpful, highest rated)
- Template marketplace (community contributions)
- Success stories feed ("Alex saved 10 hours this week")

**Virality Coefficient Target**: 0.5 (each user invites 0.5 new users)

#### Principle 4: Habit Formation (Hook Model)

**Trigger (External → Internal):**
```
Week 1: Email reminders ("Your agent is ready to chat")
Week 2: Slack/Teams integration ("Ask @AgentName")
Week 3: Mobile push ("Quick question for your agent?")
Month 2: Internal trigger (think of question → open agent)
```

**Action (Easy to do):**
- Type question in chat (friction: minimal)
- One-click follow-up questions
- Voice input option

**Reward (Variable):**
- Perfect answer (high reward)
- Good answer with sources (medium reward)
- "Let me search deeper" (anticipation)
- Unexpected insights (variable reward)

**Investment (User commits):**
- Upload more documents (invested data)
- Refine system prompt (invested time)
- Share with colleagues (invested reputation)
- Create more agents (invested workflow)

**Result**: Daily active usage within 2 weeks for 40% of users

#### Principle 5: Delight Through Intelligence

**Smart Features:**
```
Auto-complete prompts (GPT-4 powered)
Suggested follow-up questions
Automatic document categorization
Intelligent model selection (cheapest that works)
Proactive alerts ("Your agent could answer this Slack question")
```

**Wow Moments:**
- First time agent answers perfectly from uploaded doc
- Realizes agent is faster than searching
- Colleague praises shared agent
- Saves measurable time (weekly report)
- Agent prevents costly mistake

- Gross margin: >80%

**Referral/Virality Metrics:**
- Agents shared per power user: 5+
- Users invited per team: 3+
- Virality coefficient: 0.4-0.6
- Word-of-mouth attributable signups: 30%

#### Engagement Scoring Model

```javascript
healthScore = (
  agentsCreated * 10 +        // Max 30 points (3 agents)
  weeklyActiveAgents * 15 +    // Max 30 points (2 agents)
  documentsUploaded * 5 +      // Max 15 points (3 docs)
  conversationsPerWeek * 2 +   // Max 20 points (10 convos)
  agentsShared * 5             // Max 5 points (1 shared)
)

Cohorts:
90-100: Champions (5%) - Max engagement, advocates
70-89: Power Users (15%) - High engagement, expansion ready
50-69: Core Users (30%) - Regular usage, stable
30-49: At Risk (30%) - Low engagement, intervention needed
0-29: Churned (20%) - Inactive, likely to cancel
```

**Interventions by Cohort:**
- Champions: Advisory board invite, case study opportunity
- Power Users: Team plan upgrade prompt, advanced features

## 10. Technical Architecture

### 10.1 System Components

```
Frontend (Astro + React)
    ↓
API Gateway (Next.js API Routes)
    ↓
Authentication & Authorization (Supabase Auth + RBAC)
    ↓
Agent Service (Node.js + TypeScript)
    ├── Agent Manager
    ├── Knowledge Importer
    ├── Evaluation Engine
    └── Chat Handler
    ↓
External Services
    ├── LLM Providers (Google, Anthropic, OpenAI)
    ├── Vector Stores (Pinecone, Qdrant)
    ├── Storage (Supabase Storage)
    └── Analytics (Mixpanel/PostHog)
```

### 10.2 Data Models

**Database Schema (Simplified):**

```sql
-- Users & Roles
users (id, email, name, created_at)
roles (id, name, description, permissions[])
user_roles (user_id, role_id, assigned_at, assigned_by)

-- Agents
agents (id, name, description, config, owner_id, status, created_at)
agent_access (agent_id, user_id, granted_by, granted_at)
agent_knowledge (id, agent_id, source_type, content, metadata)

-- Evaluations
evaluation_requests (id, agent_id, submitted_by, status, created_at)
evaluation_results (id, request_id, test_results, overall_score, evaluator_id)
success_criteria (id, domain, expert_id, thresholds, test_cases)

-- Chat History
chat_sessions (id, agent_id, user_id, started_at)
chat_messages (id, session_id, role, content, timestamp, tokens_used, cost)

-- Audit Logs
audit_logs (id, user_id, action, resource_type, resource_id, timestamp, details)
```

### 10.3 Security Considerations

- **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 + JWT tokens
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC) enforced at API level
- **Data Encryption**: At rest (AES-256) and in transit (TLS 1.3)
- **API Rate Limiting**: Per-user and per-role limits
- **Audit Logging**: All sensitive actions logged
- **Secrets Management**: Environment variables + secure vault
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all inputs
- **CORS**: Strict CORS policies for API endpoints

## 13. Open Questions & Decisions Needed

1. **Vector Store Selection**: Pinecone vs Qdrant vs Weaviate?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with Pinecone (managed service, proven scale)

2. **Evaluation Frequency**: How often should agents be re-evaluated after approval?
   - **Proposal**: Monthly for active agents, on-demand for major changes

3. **Cost Management**: How to handle agents that exceed cost budgets?
   - **Proposal**: Automatic pause + notification when threshold reached

4. **Multi-tenancy**: Support for isolated customer tenants?
   - **Decision**: Phase 2 feature, not MVP

5. **Agent Versioning**: How to handle agent updates after approval?
   - **Proposal**: Semantic versioning, major changes require re-approval
