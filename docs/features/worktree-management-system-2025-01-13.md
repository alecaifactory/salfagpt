# Git Worktrees Management System

**Feature Created:** 2025-01-13  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Version Control & Project Management

---

## 📋 Summary

Implemented comprehensive Git worktrees management system for the Flow platform, enabling organized parallel development with full traceability, backward compatibility verification, and seamless integration with existing project rules.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

Enable developers to work on multiple features simultaneously while maintaining:
- Complete traceability of what each worktree is building
- Progress tracking and alignment with main branch
- Backward compatibility verification before merging
- Historical record of all parallel development efforts
- Integration with existing project rules and safety systems

---

## ✨ What Was Created

### 1. Worktrees Management Rule (`.cursor/rules/worktrees.mdc`)

Comprehensive project cursor rule documenting:

**Worktree Lifecycle:**
- Pre-creation validation scripts
- Creation procedures with naming conventions
- Daily maintenance routines
- Progress tracking requirements
- Pre-merge validation checks
- Safe merge procedures
- Cleanup protocols

**Key Features:**
- Complete lifecycle documentation from creation to cleanup
- Shell scripts for automation
- Integration with existing safety rules
- Backward compatibility enforcement
- Traceability requirements
- Emergency procedures

**Alignment:**
- Integrates with `branch-management.mdc`
- Follows `code-change-protocol.mdc` principles
- Enforces `data.mdc` schema consistency
- Respects `ui-features-protection.mdc` requirements
- Maintains `alignment.mdc` backward compatibility

### 2. Worktree Registry (`docs/worktrees/WORKTREE_REGISTRY.md`)

Centralized tracking document for all worktrees:

**Sections:**
- Active Worktrees (currently in progress)
- Blocked Worktrees (waiting on dependencies)
- Archived Worktrees (completed and merged)
- Metrics dashboard

**Per-Worktree Tracking:**
- Path and branch information
- Creator and creation date
- Purpose and estimated completion
- Dependencies list
- Progress checklist
- Alignment with main (commits ahead/behind)
- Modified files list
- Merge readiness checklist
- Notes and decisions

### 3. Updated Rules Alignment (`RULES_ALIGNMENT.md`)

Updated to include worktrees.mdc as the 24th project rule:
- Version updated to 2.1.0
- Added to rule inventory
- Documented alignment with core principles
- Updated all counts from 23 to 24

---

## 🔑 Key Components

### Worktree Naming Convention

```bash
Format: /path/to/worktrees/[YYYY-MM-DD]-[feature-name]
Branch: feat/feature-name-YYYY-MM-DD

Example:
/Users/alec/.cursor/worktrees/salfagpt/2025-01-13-user-analytics
feat/user-analytics-2025-01-13
```

### Pre-Creation Validation Script

Checks before creating worktree:
- Main branch up to date
- No uncommitted changes
- Worktree name available
- Sufficient disk space

### Daily Maintenance Script

Daily routine for active worktrees:
- Fetch latest from main
- Check divergence (ahead/behind)
- List modified files
- Check for potential conflicts
- Run tests
- Update registry

### Pre-Merge Validation Script

Comprehensive checks before merge:
- Rebase on latest main
- Type check
- Lint
- Build
- Protected features verification
- Backward compatibility check
- Documentation check

### Safe Merge Procedure

Step-by-step merge to main:
- Final rebase
- Switch to main repository
- Merge with `--no-ff` (preserves history)
- Final checks
- Push to remote
- Update registry

### Cleanup Procedure

Post-merge cleanup:
- Verify merge in production (24-48h wait)
- Remove worktree
- Delete local branch
- Optionally delete remote branch
- Archive in registry

## 🔄 Worktree Lifecycle Stages

```
1. Creation
   ↓ Pre-creation validation
   ↓ Create worktree + branch
   ↓ Register in WORKTREE_REGISTRY.md
   
2. Daily Maintenance
   ↓ Sync with main
   ↓ Check divergence
   ↓ Update registry
   
3. Progress Tracking
   ↓ Update checklist
   ↓ Document blockers
   ↓ Track modified files
   
4. Pre-Merge Validation
   ↓ Run comprehensive checks
   ↓ Verify backward compatibility
   ↓ Get user approval
   
5. Merge
   ↓ Final rebase
   ↓ Merge to main (--no-ff)
   ↓ Push to remote
   ↓ Update registry
   
6. Cleanup
   ↓ Verify in production
   ↓ Remove worktree
   ↓ Archive in registry
```

## 🔒 Backward Compatibility Rules

### Critical Principles

1. **Additive Only**
   - ✅ Add new fields (optional)
   - ✅ Add new endpoints
   - ✅ Add new components
   - ❌ NEVER remove existing fields
   - ❌ NEVER change field types
   - ❌ NEVER remove endpoints

2. **Feature Flags for Risky Changes**
   ```typescript
   const FEATURE_NEW = process.env.FEATURE_NEW === 'true';
   return FEATURE_NEW ? <New /> : <Old />;
   ```

3. **Database Schema**
   - All new fields optional
   - Never rename columns
   - Use migrations for transformations

4. **Compatibility Checklist**
   - [ ] All tests pass
   - [ ] No removed functionality
   - [ ] New features opt-in
   - [ ] Data structures additive
   - [ ] APIs backward compatible
   - [ ] UI fallbacks exist

## 🧹 Daily Health Check Script

Located at: `scripts/check-worktree-health.sh`

**Checks for each worktree:**
- Branch name
- Divergence from main
- Uncommitted changes
- Last commit date
- Staleness warning (>7 days)

**Output Example:**
```
🔍 Checking: /Users/alec/.cursor/worktrees/salfagpt/2025-01-13-analytics
   Branch: feat/analytics-2025-01-13
   Ahead: 5 | Behind: 2
   ✅ No uncommitted changes
   Last commit: 2025-01-15
```

## 🔗 Integration with Existing Rules

### Alignment with Core Rules

**`alignment.mdc`**
- Follows "Data Persistence First"
- Maintains "Type Safety Everywhere"
- Enforces "Security by Default"

**`branch-management.mdc`**
- Uses same branch naming conventions
- Follows branch safety protocols
- Validates before switching/merging

**`code-change-protocol.mdc`**
- Pre-commit checklist enforced
- Change validation required
- Protected features verified

**`data.mdc`**
- Schema changes must be additive
- Backward compatibility mandatory
- Data structures consistent

**`ui-features-protection.mdc`**
- Protected features checked pre-merge
- No feature removal without approval
- UI state preserved

---

## 📈 Success Metrics

### Target KPIs

- Average worktree duration: < 7 days
- Commits per day: 2-5
- Sync frequency: Daily
- Conflicts per merge: < 3
- Time to merge after "Ready": < 24 hours
- Registry update frequency: 100% daily
- Zero orphaned worktrees

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**DON'T:**
1. Create worktree without clear purpose
2. Let worktrees go stale (>14 days)
3. Skip daily syncing
4. Ignore registry updates
5. Merge without validation
6. Keep worktrees after merge
7. Work on multiple worktrees simultaneously
8. Create worktrees for small changes
