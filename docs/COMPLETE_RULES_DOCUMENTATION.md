# Complete Rules Documentation - Flow Platform

**Created:** 2025-10-12  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Total Lines:** ~12,276+ lines of comprehensive documentation

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This document provides an overview of all Cursor project rules created for the Flow platform. These rules ensure consistent development practices, prevent data loss, and maintain architectural integrity across local development and production environments.

**NEW:** 
- The `alignment.mdc` rule serves as the foundational "north star" that consolidates all design principles and architectural patterns across all layers.
- The `agents.mdc` rule documents the complete agentic architecture, where each conversation is an AI agent with its own configuration, context, and memory.
