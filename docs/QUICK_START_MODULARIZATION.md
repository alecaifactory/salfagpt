import { FlowSDK } from '@flow-ai/sdk';

const flow = new FlowSDK({ apiKey });

// Get analytics
const stats = await flow.analytics.getUsageStats({ days: 30 });

// Create agent
const agent = await flow.agents.create({
  name: 'Support Bot',
  model: 'flash',
  systemPrompt: '...'
});

// Upload context
await flow.context.upload({
  file: './kb/policies.pdf',
  agentId: agent.id

## 📈 ROI per Token (ROI/T) Framework

### **North Star Metric**

**Formula:**
```
ROI/T = Business Value Generated ($) / Tokens Consumed

Target by tier:
- Spark:      10x ROI/T
- Solo:       50x ROI/T
- Team:      100x ROI/T  
- Enterprise: 500x ROI/T
```

**Example:**
```
User asks AI to analyze contract
→ AI uses 50,000 tokens (Gemini Flash = $0.004)
→ User saves 3 hours of lawyer time ($600)
→ ROI/T = $600 / 50,000 = $0.012 per token
→ = $12,000 per 1M tokens
→ = 150,000x return on AI cost
```

**Auto-Optimization:**
- AI tracks ROI/T per interaction
- Learns which models deliver best ROI
- Automatically suggests optimizations
- Users see productivity gains in real-time

---

## 🔐 Privacy & Compliance Built-In

### **All Tiers Include:**

**GDPR Compliance:**
- ✅ Complete data isolation
- ✅ One-click data export
- ✅ One-click deletion
- ✅ Automated compliance reporting

**Encryption:**
- Spark: Platform-managed (AES-256)
- Solo: Platform or custom KMS
- Team: Team KMS key
- Enterprise: BYOK (full control)

**Data Lifecycle:**
```
Active subscription:
  → Full access, unlimited retention

Cancel subscription:
  → Grace period (30 days, full access)
  → Archive (day 31-390, read-only)
  → Final warning (day 385)
  → Permanent deletion (day 395)

Delete account:
  → Immediate stop
  → 30-day recovery window
  → Permanent deletion
  → Confirmation + final export
```

**Archival by Design:**
- All tiers: 360 days post-cancellation

## 🎯 Immediate Next Steps

### **Option A: Start This Week** (Recommended)

**Monday-Tuesday:** Review & approve
- Read: `MODULAR_PLATFORM_ARCHITECTURE.md`
- Review: Tier pricing ($0/$29/$99/Custom)
- Approve: 12-week timeline
- Assign: Development team

**Wednesday-Friday:** Begin Phase 1
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feat/modular-tiers-2025-11-16

# Implement (AI-assisted):
- Subscription collection schema
- Feature flag system  
- Module loader
- Tier middleware

# Test & demo
npm run dev
# Show: Tier-based UI variations
```

**Week 2:**
- Complete Phase 1
- Deploy to QA
- Demo to stakeholders
- **Decision:** Proceed to Phase 2?

---

### **Option B: Pilot First** (Conservative)

**Week 1: Build Spark tier only**
- Minimal viable trial experience
- Test conversion rate
- Gather user feedback

**Week 2: Iterate**
- Optimize based on feedback
- Improve conversion

**Week 3+: Build other tiers**
- Only if Spark shows promise
- Data-driven decisions

---

### **Option C: Enterprise First** (Existing Client Focus)

**Weeks 1-4: Enterprise tier only**
- Focus on current large clients
- BYOK implementation
- Custom compliance
- Prove value with existing relationships

**Weeks 5-12: Other tiers**
- Build down from Enterprise
- Proven features → simplified versions

---

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

### **1. Dunbar Number (7 users max for Team tier)**

**Why 7?**
- Optimal collaboration group (research-backed)
- Beyond 7 = communication overhead ↑ exponentially
- Natural upgrade to Enterprise

**Impact:**
- Forces focus (small effective teams)
- Clear tier boundary
- Encourages Enterprise upgrades

---

### **2. 360-Day Archive (Not 30 or 90)**

**Why 360 days?**
- Full year coverage
- Career transition-friendly (job changes take 6-12 months)
- Differentiator (competitors: 30-90 days)

**Impact:**
- User confidence (data safe for a year)
- Recovery opportunities
- Premium feel

---

### **3. Portable Personal Profile**

**Why separate Personal vs Business?**
- User loyalty (Ally goes with you)
- Career-long value (not just one job)
- Privacy-first (your learnings ≠ employer's IP)

**Impact:**
- Unique competitive moat
- Lifetime user value
- Word-of-mouth growth

---

### **4. ROI/Token vs Traditional Metrics**

**Why ROI/T instead of MRR/ARR?**
- Aligns with user success (not just revenue)
- Drives real optimization (not vanity metrics)
- Attracts high-value use cases

**Impact:**
- Product-market fit through value delivery
- Premium pricing justified
- Customer success = our success

---

## 🎓 What You Should Know

### **This is ADDITIVE (Not a Rewrite)**

- ✅ All existing features preserved
- ✅ Existing users keep working
- ✅ Zero downtime migration
- ✅ Backward compatible 100%

**Implementation approach:**
1. Build tier system alongside existing
2. Gate new features with tiers
3. Gradually migrate users to tiers (auto-assign)
4. Never remove working features

---

### **Module System = Future-Proof**

**Once modular:**
- ✅ Easy to add new features (new modules)
- ✅ Easy to test (test module in isolation)
- ✅ Easy to sell (activate modules per tier)
- ✅ Easy to maintain (clear boundaries)

**Example: Add "CRM Integration" module**
```
1. Create src/modules/crm/
2. Add to Enterprise tier config
3. Test with Enterprise users
4. Deploy
= New feature without touching core
```

---

### **Ally = Platform Intelligence**

**Not just a chatbot:**
- Ally coordinates the platform
- Ally optimizes your workflows
- Ally learns from all interactions
- Ally grows with you

**Competitive moat:**
- Others: AI responds to queries
- Flow: AI proactively optimizes your entire work life

---

## 📞 Questions Answered

### **Q: Will this break existing functionality?**

**A:** No. All changes are additive.
- Existing users: Auto-assigned tiers (no change in access)
- Existing features: All preserved
- New features: Gated by tier (doesn't affect existing users)

---

### **Q: What if we want to adjust tiers later?**

**A:** Fully flexible.
- Tier configs in `src/config/tiers.ts` (easy to edit)
- Feature flags (can A/B test tier features)
- Grandfather pricing (existing users protected)
- Can add Tier 5 anytime (just add config)

---

### **Q: How do we handle existing users?**

**A:** Automatic assignment.
```typescript
Current usage analysis:
- 1 user, <5 agents          → Solo (grandfathered pricing)
- 2-7 users, team features   → Team (grandfathered)
- 8+ users or enterprise     → Enterprise (custom migration)

All keep current pricing forever (or until they change plan)
```

---

### **Q: What's the biggest risk?**

**A:** Free tier cannibalization (users stay free, don't convert).

**Mitigation:**
1. Clear feature gates (compelling upgrade reasons)
2. 30-day limit enforced (not extendable)
3. Data archival (loss aversion → upgrade)
4. Target: 30% conversion (industry: 2-5%, we're 10x better)

**Fallback:** If <20% conversion, adjust free tier limits or pricing

---

### **Q: Why 12 weeks? Can we go faster?**

**A:** Could do 8 weeks with full team + AI.

**Conservative timeline:**
- 12 weeks = 2-week buffer per phase
- Allows for user feedback iterations
- Reduces risk of rushed mistakes

**Aggressive timeline:**
- 8 weeks = minimal viable per phase
- Faster to market
- Higher risk of technical debt

**Recommendation:** Start with 12-week plan, compress if ahead of schedule.
