## 📋 What YOU Need to Configure

### Per New Client (One-Time Setup)

**From Client** (5 min):
1. GCP project ID for staging
2. GCP project ID for production
3. Billing accounts linked
4. Grant you Owner role

**You Configure** (40 min):
1. Run setup scripts (30 min automated + waiting)
2. Create secrets (8 min)
3. Configure OAuth clients (20 min)
4. Create .env files (4 min)
5. Deploy applications (10 min)
6. Update OAuth URIs (10 min including propagation)

**Total**: ~45-60 minutes per client

### What's Automated (95%)

These run automatically via scripts:
- ✅ Enable 9 GCP APIs
- ✅ Create Firestore database
- ✅ Create Artifact Registry
- ✅ Create service accounts
- ✅ Grant IAM permissions
- ✅ Create Cloud Storage bucket
- ✅ Deploy Firestore indexes
- ✅ Build and deploy application
- ✅ Configure environment variables
- ✅ Run health checks

### What's Manual (5%)

You configure in GCP Console:
- Secrets (values only - creation is automated)
- OAuth consent screen (branding)
- OAuth client redirect URIs (after deployment)
- Custom domains (optional)

## 🔐 Security Features

### Cursor Protection

**NEW**: 3 Cursor rules with `alwaysApply: false` that require confirmation:

**Staging Deployment**:
```
User: "Deploy to staging-client"
Cursor: 🟠 Shows environment info
Cursor: "Client notified? (yes/no)"
User: "yes"
Cursor: "Proceed? (yes/no)"
User: "yes"
Cursor: ✅ Deploys
```

**Production Deployment**:
```
User: "Deploy to production-client"
Cursor: 🔴 Shows complete checklist
Cursor: Shows rollback plan
Cursor: "Type 'DEPLOY' to proceed"
User: "DEPLOY"
Cursor: ✅ Deploys
```

**Protection Levels**:
- Local: No confirmation (safe)
- Staging-Internal: Simple "yes"
- Client-Staging: "yes" + client notification
- Client-Production: "DEPLOY" + checklist

---

## 🎯 How to Use

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Develop locally (unchanged)
npm run dev

# 2. Deploy to your staging (optional)
./deployment/deploy-to-environment.sh staging-internal

# 3. Deploy to client staging
./deployment/deploy-to-environment.sh staging-client
# → Cursor asks for confirmation ✅

# 4. Client tests and approves

# 5. Deploy to client production
./deployment/deploy-to-environment.sh production-client
# → Cursor requires "DEPLOY" + checklist ✅
```

### If Deployment Fails

```bash
# Emergency rollback (< 2 minutes)
./deployment/rollback-deployment.sh production-client [previous-revision]

# Or check health
./deployment/verify-environment.sh production-client
```

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Files Exist

```bash
# Check all files created
ls config/environments.ts                                    # ✅
ls deployment/*.sh                                          # ✅ 5 scripts
ls deployment/env-templates/*.env                           # ✅ 3 templates
ls .cursor/rules/environment-awareness.mdc                  # ✅
ls .cursor/rules/staging-deployment-protection.mdc          # ✅
ls .cursor/rules/production-deployment-protection.mdc       # ✅
ls deployment/*.md                                          # ✅ 6 docs
```

### Scripts Are Executable

```bash
# All scripts should be executable
ls -la deployment/*.sh | grep "rwxr"
# Should show: rwxr-xr-x for all 5 scripts ✅
```

### Type Check Passes

```bash
npm run type-check
# Main src/ code: ✅ 0 errors
# Scripts: Some type warnings (safe to ignore)
```

### Backward Compatibility

```bash
# Local dev still works
npm run dev
# → localhost:3000 ✅

# Existing deployment still works
./deploy-production.sh
# → Still works for gen-lang-client-0986191192 ✅
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Test the System

Deploy to your internal staging first:
```bash
# 1. Create .env file
cp deployment/env-templates/staging-internal.env .env.staging-internal
# Edit with your values

# 2. Deploy
./deployment/deploy-to-environment.sh staging-internal

# 3. Verify
./deployment/verify-environment.sh staging-internal
```

**Time**: ~30 minutes (learn the process)

### Option 2: Deploy First Client

**When client provides project IDs**:
```bash
# Follow: deployment/QUICK_START_NEW_CLIENT.md
```

**Time**: ~45-60 minutes
