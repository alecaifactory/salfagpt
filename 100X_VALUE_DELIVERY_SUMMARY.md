## 🎯 **Marketing Messaging Principles**

### **1. Lead with Value, Not Features**

❌ **Feature-Focused:**
"SalfaGPT uses RAG with vector embeddings and Gemini 2.5"

✅ **Value-Focused:**
"SalfaGPT transforms 60-minute searches into 60-second answers"

---

### **2. Show, Don't Tell**

❌ **Telling:**
"SalfaGPT is very fast"

✅ **Showing:**
"8 seconds vs 60 minutes. That's 450x faster. See it yourself: [GIF]"

---

### **3. Specific Numbers, Not Vague Claims**

❌ **Vague:**
"Much cheaper than hiring experts"

✅ **Specific:**
"$0.02 per query vs $100-200 manual search. That's 5,000-10,000x cheaper."

---

### **4. Address Objections Proactively**

**Objection 1: "Can I trust AI?"**
```
Answer:
"Every answer includes clickable references to source documents.
You verify in 30 seconds, not blind faith.
Plus: Expert validation ensures quality."
```

**Objection 2: "It's probably slow"**
```
Answer:
"<8 seconds for complete answer with sources.
Faster than opening a PDF.
See demo: [GIF]"
```

**Objection 3: "Too complicated to learn"**
```
Answer:
"3 steps: Select agent → Ask question → Read answer.
If you can use Google, you can use SalfaGPT.
Try it: [Link]"
```

**Objection 4: "My case is different"**
```
Answer:
"15 specialized agents cover legal, safety, ops, admin, construction.
If your docs are in the system, we can answer.
Not sure? Try one question: [Link]"
```
