# Context Filtering Fix - PUBLIC Only

**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Issue:** Non-PUBLIC sources appearing in new agents  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem

### What Was Happening
```
User creates new agent
    ↓
Loads context sources
    ↓
Shows ALL sources without assignedToAgents
    ↓
❌ Old sources (no assignment data) appear by default
❌ Agent has context it shouldn't have
```

### Why It Happened
Backward compatibility logic in `loadContextForConversation`:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (Too permissive)
.filter((source: any) => {
  return !source.assignedToAgents ||           // ❌ Empty = show all
         source.assignedToAgents.length === 0 || // ❌ Empty array = show all
         source.assignedToAgents.includes(conversationId); // ✅ Assigned
})
```

This showed:
- ✅ Sources explicitly assigned to agent
- ❌ Sources with no `assignedToAgents` field (old data)
- ❌ Sources with empty `assignedToAgents: []` (orphaned)

---

## ✅ Solution

### New Filtering Logic

```typescript
// NEW CODE (Strict)
.filter((source: any) => {
  // Show if:
  // 1. Tagged as PUBLIC (always visible), OR
  // 2. Explicitly assigned to this agent
  const isPublic = source.tags?.includes('PUBLIC');
  const isAssigned = source.assignedToAgents?.includes(conversationId);
  
  return isPublic || isAssigned;
})
```

Now shows ONLY:
- ✅ Sources tagged as PUBLIC (for all agents)
- ✅ Sources explicitly assigned to this specific agent
- ❌ Everything else (hidden by default)

## 🧪 Test Verification

### Test 1: Create Brand New Agent (30 sec)

**No PUBLIC sources exist:**
```
1. Click "Nuevo Agente"
2. Agent created
3. Look at "Fuentes de Contexto"
4. ✅ VERIFY: Empty (no sources shown)
5. Message: "No hay fuentes de contexto"

Result: ✅ Clean start, no unwanted sources
```

**With PUBLIC sources:**
```
1. First, mark one source as PUBLIC
2. Click "Nuevo Agente"
3. Look at "Fuentes de Contexto"
4. ✅ VERIFY: Only PUBLIC source(s) appear
5. ✅ VERIFY: Toggle is ON for PUBLIC sources
6. Console: "✅ X fuentes PUBLIC asignadas"

Result: ✅ Only PUBLIC sources, as intended
```

---

### Test 2: Existing Agent with Sources (15 sec)

```
1. Switch to "MultiDocs" agent
2. Look at "Fuentes de Contexto"
3. ✅ VERIFY: Shows assigned sources
4. ✅ VERIFY: Shows PUBLIC sources
5. ✅ VERIFY: Doesn't show unrelated sources

Result: ✅ Correct filtering per agent
```

---

### Test 3: Agent Isolation (30 sec)

```
1. Go to Agent A
2. Upload source (don't mark PUBLIC)
3. Source appears in Agent A ✅
4. Switch to Agent B
5. ✅ VERIFY: Source NOT visible in Agent B
6. Switch back to Agent A
7. ✅ VERIFY: Source still visible in Agent A

Result: ✅ Perfect agent isolation
```

## 🔍 Console Messages

### BEFORE Fix
```
✅ Mostrando solo fuentes asignadas: 3 fuentes (0 activas) para agente new-agent-123

(But shows sources that shouldn't be there)
```

### AFTER Fix ✨
```
✅ Contexto cargado: 0 fuentes (0 PUBLIC, 0 activas) para agente new-agent-123

Or with PUBLIC:
✅ Contexto cargado: 2 fuentes (2 PUBLIC, 2 activas) para agente new-agent-456
```

The message now clearly shows:
- Total sources shown
- How many are PUBLIC
- How many are active (toggled on)

---

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### Scenario 1: Fresh Install (No PUBLIC Sources)

#### Creating New Agent
```
New Agent created
    ↓
Scans for PUBLIC sources → None found
    ↓
assignedToAgents: [] (empty)
    ↓
Loads context → Filters by:
  - isPublic? ❌ (no PUBLIC sources)
  - isAssigned? ❌ (empty assignment)
    ↓
Result: 0 sources shown ✅
    ↓
Clean slate, ready for agent-specific uploads
```

---

### Scenario 2: With PUBLIC Sources Setup

#### Creating New Agent
```
New Agent created
    ↓
Scans for PUBLIC sources → Found 2
    ↓
Auto-assigns to new agent
assignedToAgents: [new-agent-id]
    ↓
Loads context → Filters by:
  - Source 1: isPublic? ✅ → SHOW
  - Source 2: isPublic? ✅ → SHOW
  - Source 3: isPublic? ❌, isAssigned? ❌ → HIDE
    ↓
Result: 2 PUBLIC sources shown ✅
    ↓
Agent has company baseline context
```

---

### Scenario 3: Switching Between Agents

#### Agent A → Agent B
```
Agent A has:
- Company Info (PUBLIC) ✅
- CV Tomas (assigned to A) ✅

Switch to Agent B
    ↓
Loads context → Filters by:
  - Company Info: isPublic? ✅ → SHOW
  - CV Tomas: isPublic? ❌, isAssigned to B? ❌ → HIDE
    ↓
Result: Only Company Info shown ✅
    ↓
Perfect isolation between agents
```

## 🔒 Data Cleanup (Optional)

### If You Want to Clean Old Sources

If you have sources with no assignment, you can either:

**Option 1: Tag them as PUBLIC (if company-wide)**
```
1. Click settings on each source
2. Check PUBLIC checkbox
3. Now visible in all agents
```

**Option 2: Manually assign (if agent-specific)**
```
1. Click settings on source
2. (Future: assign to specific agents)
3. Or delete and re-upload to current agent
```

**Option 3: Delete (if no longer needed)**
```
1. Click 🗑️ on each source
2. Permanently removes from all agents
```

---

## 📋 Migration Notes

### Existing Sources
- Sources uploaded before this fix may have no `assignedToAgents`
- They will now be **hidden** from all agents
- This is **intentional** - forces explicit assignment
- Use PUBLIC tag or manual assignment to make visible

### No Automatic Migration
- We don't auto-assign old sources
- Clean slate approach preferred
- User has full control over visibility

---

## ✅ Quality Check

### Type Safety
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ Proper optional chaining (`source.tags?.includes`)
- ✅ Clear boolean logic

### Backward Compatibility
- ✅ PUBLIC tag is optional
- ✅ assignedToAgents is optional
- ✅ Old sources without these fields are simply hidden
- ✅ No data loss (sources still in Firestore)

### Performance
- ✅ Single filter pass (O(n))
- ✅ No additional API calls
- ✅ Efficient boolean checks

---

## 🎓 Design Decision

### Why Strict Filtering?

**Decision:** Only show sources that are explicitly visible (PUBLIC or assigned)

**Rationale:**
1. **Clean defaults** - New agents start empty
2. **Explicit intent** - User chooses what each agent sees
3. **No surprises** - Sources don't magically appear
4. **Better organization** - Forces proper tagging/assignment

**Alternative Rejected:** Show all sources by default
- ❌ Clutters context panel
- ❌ Violates agent isolation principle
- ❌ Confusing for users
- ❌ Defeats purpose of assignedToAgents

---

## 🎯 Summary

### What Changed
- **Filtering logic:** Now requires PUBLIC tag OR explicit assignment
- **Backward compat removed:** No longer shows unassigned sources
- **Result:** Clean, predictable behavior

### Impact
- ✅ New agents start empty (unless PUBLIC exists)
- ✅ Perfect agent isolation
- ✅ No unwanted context bleeding
- ✅ Forces intentional assignment

### User Action Required
- Tag company-wide sources as PUBLIC
- Or assign sources to specific agents
- Or they won't be visible (intentional)

---

## 🧪 Quick Test

```bash
# In browser console (on new agent):
console.log('Context sources:', contextSources);
console.log('PUBLIC sources:', contextSources.filter(s => s.tags?.includes('PUBLIC')));
console.log('Assigned sources:', contextSources.filter(s => s.assignedToAgents?.includes(currentConversation)));

Expected:
- Only PUBLIC or assigned sources in contextSources
- No sources with empty/null assignedToAgents
```

## 📚 Related Changes

This fix works together with:
- PUBLIC tag system (auto-assignment)
- Agent-specific context isolation
- Context source settings (tag management)

---

**Status:** ✅ Fixed and ready  
**Impact:** Cleaner, more predictable context behavior  
**User Benefit:** No surprises, explicit control  

---

**Test it now!** Create a new agent and verify it starts with NO context (or only PUBLIC if you've tagged any). 🎯
