# Flow CLI - Executive Summary

**Version**: 0.1.0 | **Date**: 2025-10-30 | **Status**: ✅ Ready to Test

---

## 🎯 What Was Built (30-Second Summary)

Created a **secure npm package** that lets domain admins view usage statistics instantly:

```bash
# Install
npm install -g @flow-ai/cli

# Login (one time)
flow login <api-key>

# Get stats (< 3 seconds)
flow usage-stats @mydomain.com
```

**Result**: Beautiful terminal tables showing users, agents, messages, costs.

---

## 🔐 Security Model

```
SuperAdmin creates API key
    ↓
Key is hashed (SHA-256)
    ↓
Assigned to admin@domain.com
    ↓
Admin can ONLY access @domain.com data
    ↓
Key can expire after 90 days
    ↓
Can be revoked instantly
```

✅ **Enterprise-grade security**
