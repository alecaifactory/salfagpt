# ✅ Upload Fixed - Test Now!

**Issue:** 404 errors + Processing timeout  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed  
**Server:** ✅ Running on http://localhost:3000

---

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Eliminated 404 Errors
**Problem:** 30+ calls to `/api/context-sources/undefined`

**Fix:** Removed broken polling mechanism, now creates source immediately after extraction

**Result:** NO more 404 errors ✅

### 2. Fixed Processing Timeout
**Problem:** Files timing out after 30 seconds

**Fix:**  
- Removed 30-second timeout
- Increased maxOutputTokens for large files
- Pro can now handle 65k tokens (files >10MB)

**Result:** Larger files can extract successfully ✅

### 3. Improved Upload Flow
**New flow:**
```
Upload → Extract (Gemini) → Save to Firestore → Complete
(All synchronous, no polling, no timeouts)
```
