- Flash: 94% cheaper but may need re-extraction
- Default to Pro, offer Flash as alternative

### 2. Token Tracking is Essential
- Users need to see costs upfront
- Transparency builds trust
- Helps optimize model selection

### 3. Visual Indicators are Critical
- Badges make model instantly recognizable
- Color coding (green/purple) is intuitive
- Warnings guide better decisions

### 4. Firestore Auth Can Expire
- Application Default Credentials need renewal
- Server restart required after re-auth
- Vite cache can get corrupted (clear it)
