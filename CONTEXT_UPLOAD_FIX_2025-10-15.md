# Context Upload Fix - 404 Errors Resolved
**Date:** 2025-10-15  
**Issue:** Multiple 404 errors on `/api/context-sources/undefined`  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem Identified

### Issue 1: 404 Errors
**Symptom:**
```
api/context-sources/undefined:1 Failed to load resource: 404 (Not Found)
```
(Repeated ~30 times)

**Root Cause:**
- ContextManagementDashboard was trying to poll for sources that didn't exist yet
- The extraction API only extracts text, it doesn't create the Firestore document
- Dashboard was passing `undefined` as sourceId to the polling function

### Issue 2: Processing Timeout
**Symptom:**
```
DDU-ESP-009-07.pdf
Processing timeout
```

**Root Cause:**
- Polling function had 30-second timeout
- Large files take longer to extract
- Timeout was too aggressive

---

## ✅ Fix Applied

### 1. Removed Polling Mechanism
**Old Flow:**
```
Upload → Extract → Poll for sourceId → Wait → Check status → Repeat
(sourceId was undefined, caused 404 errors)
```

**New Flow:**
```
Upload → Extract → Create Firestore source → Complete
(No polling, no undefined sourceId, no 404 errors)
```

### 2. Synchronous Upload
**Changes in `ContextManagementDashboard.tsx`:**
```typescript
// OLD (causing 404s):
const uploadData = await uploadResponse.json();
await pollForCompletion(item.id, uploadData.sourceId); // sourceId was undefined!

// NEW (fixed):
const uploadData = await uploadResponse.json();

// Create source immediately after extraction
const createResponse = await fetch('/api/context-sources', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId,
    name: item.file.name,
    type: 'pdf',
    extractedData: uploadData.extractedText,
    assignedToAgents: [], // Admin upload - not assigned initially
    metadata: uploadData.metadata
  })
});

const savedData = await createResponse.json();
// Mark complete immediately - no polling needed
```

### 3. Increased Token Limits
**Changes in `extract-document.ts`:**
```typescript
// OLD:
if (fileSizeMB > 5) return 32768; // Pro
if (fileSizeMB > 2) return 16384;

// NEW:
if (fileSizeMB > 10) return 65536; // Max for Pro
if (fileSizeMB > 5) return 32768;  // Handle larger files
```

### 4. Changed Default Model to Pro
```typescript
formData.append('model', 'gemini-2.5-pro'); // Was Flash, now Pro
```

## 🧪 How to Test

### Clear Old Queue
1. Close the Context Management modal
2. Refresh the page
3. Open Context Management again

### Upload New File
1. Click the upload area or drag & drop
2. Select a PDF
3. Watch the upload queue

**Expected:**
- ✅ File uploads
- ✅ Extracts content
- ✅ Saves to Firestore
- ✅ Shows as "complete" (green checkmark)
- ✅ **NO 404 errors** in console
- ✅ **NO polling** messages
- ✅ Appears in "All Context Sources" list

---

## 📊 What Changed

1. **src/components/ContextManagementDashboard.tsx**
   - Removed polling mechanism
   - Creates source immediately after extraction
   - Changed default model to Pro
   - No more 404 errors

2. **src/pages/api/extract-document.ts**
   - Increased maxOutputTokens for large files
   - Pro can now handle files >10MB with 65k token limit
   - Better error handling

### Files Not Changed
- ContextManager.tsx (sidebar upload still works)
- ChatInterfaceWorking.tsx (agent upload still works)
- AddSourceModal.tsx (already fixed)

## ✅ Verification

After refresh, you should see:

### Upload Queue
- [ ] File appears in queue
- [ ] Progress: 0% → 10% → 70% → 100%
- [ ] Status: queued → uploading → processing → complete
- [ ] **NO "Processing timeout" error**
- [ ] Green checkmark when complete

### Console
- [ ] **NO 404 errors** (api/context-sources/undefined)
- [ ] Shows extraction progress
- [ ] Shows token usage
- [ ] Shows cost
- [ ] Shows "✅ Loaded 7 context sources"

### Source List
- [ ] Newly uploaded file appears
- [ ] Shows content preview
- [ ] Shows metadata
- [ ] Can click to view details

## 🚨 If Still Having Issues

### Issue: Upload Still Times Out
**Solution:**
- File may be too large (>50MB)
- Try smaller file first (<5MB)
- Check console for specific error

### Issue: Still See 404 Errors
**Solution:**
- Hard refresh browser (Cmd+Shift+R)
- Clear browser cache
- Restart dev server

### Issue: File Doesn't Appear in List
**Solution:**
- Click "🔄 Refresh" button
- Check console for Firestore errors
- Verify file extracted successfully

## 🎯 Expected Behavior Now

### Upload Flow
```
1. Select file
   ↓
2. Upload to /api/extract-document
   ↓
3. Gemini extracts content (may take 10-30 seconds)
   ↓
4. Create source in Firestore
   ↓
5. Mark complete in queue
   ↓
6. Reload sources list
   ↓
7. File appears in "All Context Sources"
```

**NO polling, NO undefined sourceIds, NO 404 errors** ✅

---

## 💡 Key Changes

1. **Synchronous flow** - No more polling
2. **Immediate creation** - Source created right after extraction
3. **Higher limits** - Can handle larger files (up to 65k output tokens)
4. **Better model** - Pro by default for admin uploads
5. **Clean errors** - No more 404 spam

---

## 🚀 Test Again

```bash
# Server should still be running on :3000
# If not:
npm run dev

# Then:
# 1. Refresh browser page
# 2. Open Context Management modal
# 3. Upload a PDF
# 4. Watch for NO 404 errors
# 5. File should complete successfully
```
