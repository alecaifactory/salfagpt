## 🚨 If Something Fails

### Upload Error?
**Check console for:**
```javascript
❌ Error adding source: [error message]
```

**Common fixes:**
- API key not set → Add GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY to .env
- Network error → Check internet connection
- Quota exceeded → Wait 5 minutes or use Flash model

### No Content Extracted?
**Check console for:**
```javascript
✅ Extraction successful: 0 characters extracted
```

**Possible causes:**
- PDF is image-based (scanned)
- File corrupted
- File too large

**Solutions:**
- Try smaller file
- Try Pro model (if using Flash)
- Verify PDF has selectable text

### Source Not Appearing?
**Check console for:**
```javascript
✅ Fuente guardada en Firestore: [id]
```

**If missing:**
- Firestore connection issue
- Check .env has GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT
- Check authentication

**Note:** If you requested "gemini-2.5-sonnet", I implemented with **gemini-2.5-pro** instead, as Sonnet is not available in Google's Gemini lineup. Pro is the most capable model for document interpretation, which aligns with your needs.
