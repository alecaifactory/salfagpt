- ✅ `/chat` is now the primary application page

### 2. Updated Landing Page (`/`)
**File:** `src/pages/index.astro`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (session) {
  return Astro.redirect('/home');  // ❌ Old
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (session) {
  return Astro.redirect('/chat');  // ✅ New
}
```

### 3. Updated SuperAdmin Page
**File:** `src/pages/superadmin.astro`

**File:** `src/pages/expertos.astro`

**Changes:**

## 🔄 New User Flow

### Before (Old Flow)
```
Landing Page (/) 
  → Login with Google 
  → Callback 
  → /home ❌
  → User clicks "Chat" 
  → /chat
```

### After (New Flow)
```
Landing Page (/) 
  → Login with Google 
  → Callback 
  → /chat ✅ (direct to main app)
```

**Benefit:** One less redirect, faster access to main functionality

---

## ✅ Verification

### Server Status
```
✅ Server: Running on localhost:3000
✅ Landing page: Returns 200 OK
✅ Chat page: Returns 200 OK
✅ OAuth: Configured for port 3000
```

### Routes Verified
- ✅ `/` - Landing page with login
- ✅ `/chat` - Main chat interface (after login)
- ✅ `/superadmin` - Links to /chat
- ✅ `/expertos` - Links to /chat
- ✅ `/auth/login` - OAuth flow
- ✅ `/auth/callback` - Redirects to /chat

### Deleted Routes
- ❌ `/home` - Removed (no longer needed)

## 🚨 Firestore Connection Issue (Separate)

**Note:** The logs show a Firestore authentication error:

```
error: "invalid_grant"
error_description: "reauth related error (invalid_rapt)"
```

**Cause:** Google Cloud credentials expired

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
✅ gcloud auth application-default login
✅ Credentials saved
✅ Project: gen-lang-client-0986191192
```

**Next Step:** Refresh browser to load conversations

The Firestore issue is unrelated to the /home page removal. After browser refresh, conversations should load properly.
