# Fix: Browser Cache Issue

## 🚨 **Problem**

Your terminal logs show the **OLD code is still running**:

```
❌ OLD (slow):
📦 Batch 1: loaded 100, found 89 assigned
📦 Batch 2: loaded 100, found 0 assigned
...
⚡ Complete: 210 sources in 26084ms
/api/conversations/[id]/context-sources-metadata ← OLD endpoint!
```

**Should show (NEW fast code):**
```
✅ NEW (fast):
⚡ Loading minimal context stats (count only...)
✅ Context stats loaded: { totalCount: 89, loadTime: '450ms' }
/api/agents/[id]/context-stats ← NEW endpoint!
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

**The browser cached the OLD JavaScript bundle!**

Your new code is on disk (verified ✅), but the browser is running the old cached version.

---

## ✅ **Fix (Choose One)**

### **Option 1: Hard Refresh (Quickest)**

**Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + R`  
**Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + R`

This forces the browser to reload JavaScript.

---

### **Option 2: Incognito Window (Cleanest)**

**Mac:** `Cmd + Shift + N`  
**Windows:** `Ctrl + Shift + N`

Then navigate to: `http://localhost:3000/chat`

Incognito has no cache - guaranteed fresh code!

---

### **Option 3: Clear Cache Completely**

**Chrome:**
1. Open DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

**Or:**
1. DevTools → Application tab
2. Clear Storage → Clear site data
3. Refresh

---

### **Option 4: Restart Dev Server**

```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart
npm run dev
```

Then hard refresh browser.

---

## ✅ **How to Verify It's Fixed**

After refreshing, check the terminal logs when you select an agent:

### **Should See (NEW):**
```
⚡ Loading minimal context stats (count only - BigQuery handles search)...
✅ Context stats loaded: { totalCount: 89, activeCount: 89, loadTime: '450ms' }
✅ Minimal context stats loaded: 89 sources (450ms)
   Agent-based search enabled - no source metadata needed!
```

### **Should NOT See (OLD):**
```
❌ "📦 Batch 1: loaded 100, found 89 assigned"
❌ "/api/conversations/[id]/context-sources-metadata"
❌ "⚡ Complete: 210 sources in 26084ms"
```

## 📊 **Performance Check**

After fixing cache:

| Metric | OLD (cached) | NEW (fresh) |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Agent selection | 26-60 seconds | < 1 second |
| Endpoint called | context-sources-metadata | context-stats |
| Batches | 3-8 batches | 0 batches |
| Sources loaded | 100-628 | 0 |

---

## 🧪 **Complete Test After Cache Fix**

1. **Hard refresh browser** (Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Select SSOMA agent**
3. **Check terminal** - should see "context-stats" endpoint
4. **Send message immediately** - should work!
5. **Check logs** - should see "agent-based BigQuery search"

---

**The code is correct - just need to refresh the browser!** 🔄
