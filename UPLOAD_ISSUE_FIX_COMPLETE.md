# 🔧 Upload Issue Fixed + Progress Bar Enhanced

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Ready to restart server and test

---

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### 1. Removed Problematic RAG Auto-Enable
- Changed RAG to explicit opt-in only
- No longer runs by default
- Upload works as before (full-text mode)

### 2. Removed Unused Import
- Removed `@google-cloud/storage` import
- Wasn't being used in modified code
- Could have caused initialization issues

### 3. Enhanced Progress Bar
- ✅ Smooth millisecond updates (23.5s format)
- ✅ Timer updates every 100ms (10x per second)
- ✅ Blue progress bar during upload
- ✅ Green on complete with final time

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Restart the Dev Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

**Why restart needed:**
- Code changes require server reload
- Fixed RAG opt-in logic
- Fixed imports
- Progress enhancements applied

### Test Upload Again

1. Open Context Management
2. Upload your PDF (DDU-ESP-019-07.pdf)
3. Should work now with smooth progress
4. Watch elapsed time: `5.3s` → `10.7s` → `23.5s` etc.

**Expected:**
```
⟳ DDU-ESP-019-07.pdf          15.3s
████████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
Extracting...                   60%
```

When complete:
```
✓ DDU-ESP-019-07.pdf        ✓ 45.2s
██████████████████████████████████
Complete                       100%
```

## 🐛 If Upload Still Fails

### Check Server Logs

Look in terminal where `npm run dev` is running:
- Should show: `📄 Extracting text from...`
- If error, will show: `❌ Error...`

### Common Issues

**1. Server not running:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**2. Server needs restart:**
```bash
# Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

**3. File type issue:**
- Only PDF, PNG, JPEG supported
- Check file isn't corrupted

**4. File too large:**
- Max 50MB
- Check file size

npm run dev
```

**Then upload your PDF!**

You should see:
- ✅ Smooth progress bar
- ✅ Live elapsed time (23.5s format)
- ✅ Success with green checkmark
