# Context Source Assignment Fix - 2025-10-15

## üéØ Problem

When creating a new agent, private context sources (PDFs without PUBLIC tag) were appearing automatically due to backward compatibility logic.

**Example:**
- User creates new agent
- Sees: DDU-ESP-031-09.pdf, DDU-ESP-028-07.pdf, DDU-ESP-022-07.pdf, DDU-ESP-009-07.pdf
- These are **private** documents (no PUBLIC tag)
- Should NOT appear unless explicitly assigned

## üîß Root Cause

In `ChatInterfaceWorking.tsx` line 262:

```typescript
// OLD CODE (PROBLEM)
const hasNoAssignment = !source.assignedToAgents || source.assignedToAgents.length === 0;
return hasPublicTag || isAssignedToThisAgent || hasNoAssignment;
//                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
//                                              This showed ALL legacy sources
```

**Why this existed:** Backward compatibility for sources created before the `assignedToAgents` feature was implemented.

**Problem:** All old PDFs (without assignedToAgents) appeared in ALL new agents.

## ‚úÖ Solution

**Changed filter logic** to only show:
1. ‚úÖ Sources with PUBLIC tag (`labels` includes 'PUBLIC')
2. ‚úÖ Sources explicitly assigned to this agent (`assignedToAgents` includes `agentId`)

```typescript
// NEW CODE (FIXED)
const hasPublicTag = source.labels?.includes('PUBLIC') || source.labels?.includes('public');
const isAssignedToThisAgent = source.assignedToAgents?.includes(conversationId);

return hasPublicTag || isAssignedToThisAgent;
// Removed: || hasNoAssignment
```

## üìã Impact

### Before Fix
- New agent shows: ALL private PDFs (4 shown in screenshot)
- Confusing for users
- Context pollution

### After Fix
- New agent shows: ONLY PUBLIC sources
- Clean slate for new agents
- Users explicitly assign private sources

### Existing Agents
- **No change** - Already have `assignedToAgents` correctly set
- Will continue to see their assigned sources

## üß™ Testing

### Test 1: Create New Agent (Should be Clean)
```bash
1. Login to http://localhost:3000/chat
2. Click "+ Nuevo Agente"
3. Check "Fuentes de Contexto" section
4. Should be EMPTY (no PDFs shown)
```

**Expected:**
```
‚úÖ No sources shown
‚úÖ Message: "No hay fuentes de contexto"
```

### Test 2: Existing Agent (Should Keep Sources)
```bash
1. Select an existing agent that had PDFs
2. Check "Fuentes de Contexto" section
3. Should show the PDFs it was assigned
```

**Expected:**
```
‚úÖ Assigned PDFs still visible
‚úÖ Can toggle on/off
‚úÖ No change to existing data
```

### Test 3: PUBLIC Sources (Should Auto-Assign)
```bash
1. Create a PUBLIC source (tag it with PUBLIC)
2. Create a new agent
3. Check if PUBLIC source appears
```

**Expected:**
```
‚úÖ PUBLIC source visible in new agent
‚úÖ Auto-enabled by default
```

## üìä Files Modified

- `src/components/ChatInterfaceWorking.tsx` - Removed backward compat logic

## üîÑ Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible:**
- Existing agents keep their assigned sources
- PUBLIC sources still work as expected
- Only affects NEW agents (no legacy sources shown)

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Code fix applied
2. ‚è≥ Test new agent creation
3. ‚è≥ Verify existing agents unchanged
4. ‚è≥ Optional: Tag documents as PUBLIC if they should be in all agents

## üí° How to Make Documents PUBLIC

If a document SHOULD appear in all agents:

1. Open Context Management Dashboard
2. Find the document
3. Add tag "PUBLIC"
4. Save
5. Document will now auto-assign to all new agents

**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed - Ready for Testing  
**Backward Compatible:** Yes  
**Breaking Changes:** None  
**User Impact:** Positive - cleaner new agents
