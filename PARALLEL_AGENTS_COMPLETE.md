## 💡 Pro Tips

### Max Parallelization
```
1. Start 5 agents on different tasks
2. Each shows its own timer
3. Fastest finishes first → 🔔
4. Work on that while others continue
5. Next finishes → 🔔
6. Keep switching to completed agents
7. Handle all tasks in parallel!
```

### Archive Strategy
```
1. Active projects → Keep in main list
2. Completed projects → Archive
3. Need to reference old project → Expand "Archivados"
4. Frequently need old project → Restore it
5. Many archives → Use "Ver todos" modal
```

### Feedback Workflow
```
1. See ⚠️ Feedback badge → Agent needs input
2. Click agent → See what it needs
3. Provide information
4. Badge clears when new response arrives
```
